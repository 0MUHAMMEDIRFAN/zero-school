# Why Use Shared Application, Separate Database Multitenancy Architecture

Using a shared application with a separate database multitenancy architecture offers several advantages:

1. **Easy Data Backup**: Each customer's data can be backed up independently, making the backup process more manageable and efficient.
2. **Enhanced Security**: Separate databases ensure that each customer's data is isolated, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
3. **Scalability**: It allows for easier scaling of resources as each database can be scaled independently based on the customer's needs.
4. **Customization**: Different customers can have customized database schemas without affecting others.
5. **Performance Isolation**: Performance issues in one customer's database do not impact others, ensuring consistent performance across tenants.
6. **Compliance**: Easier to comply with data protection regulations as data is isolated per customer.
7. **Maintenance**: Simplifies maintenance tasks such as updates and migrations, as they can be performed on a per-database basis.

This architecture provides a balance between resource sharing and data isolation, making it a robust choice for multi-tenant applications.
